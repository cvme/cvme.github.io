Over the years, progress on computer vision research has effectively benefitted medical domain, leading to development of several high impact image-guided interventions and therapies. While past couple of years have seen tremendous progress on 3D computer vision, especially in ADAS or driver-less navigation domains, the impact on medical domain has been limited. This workshop is to bring together the practitioners of 3D computer vision and medical domain and engage in a dialogue emphasizing the key recent advances and bridging the gap between 3d computer vision research and potential medical applications. 

The talks in the workshop cover following topics,
- **3D human body modeling and estimation**
Human body modeling (or patient modeling) is critical to several applications such as patient positioning for medical scanning, support for prosthetic design, computed assisted rehabilitation systems.
- **Non-rigid shape representation**
For human body, organs, vessels etc.; topics that emphasize the trade offs involved in volumetric or point-based representations
- **Endoscopic imaging and analysis for surgical guidance**
3D reconstruction using endoscopic imaging to provide guidance to surgical procedures
- **Scene representation and modeling for surgical and scanning workflow analysis** To localize the physicians and medical devices for workflow analysis during medical scanning as well as surgery and/or enable augmented reality applications
- **Scene reconstruction for navigation**
For navigation and path planning for devices
